{"name":"OPTI-G","tagline":"Optimization program for G-code","body":"# OPTI-G\r\nThis is an optimization program for G code, and this is done by reorder the cuts, to minimize the distance between those.\r\nUse it entirely at your own risk! It can still contain bugs!\r\n\r\n## The program:\r\n![GUI](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/runeSal/OPTI-G/master/Images/GUI%20v.0.4.1.PNG)\r\n\r\nThere is no different between how the software handle Etch and Drill files, and other G-code files can also be optimized by this program.\r\n\r\n## The optimization:\r\nThe optimizing support both where the cut enter and stop at different places and the cut enter and exit the same place. The used optimizing do NOT support G-code, where the order of the cuts between tool change are important, and need to be performed in sequence.\r\nIf you are interested in the algorithm used to optimize the G-code more information can be found on this\r\n[link](http://hackaday.io/project/4955-g-code-optimizing).\r\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/runeSal/OPTI-G/master/Images/random%20cities%20before%20after%20OPTI-G.PNG)\r\n\r\n## Installation:\r\n1. Download the project and unpack it. \r\n2. Now there are two options\r\n\t* Move the 'Program' folder to location you want, and run the program from here. Make sure you have .NET 4.5 to run the program.\r\n\t* Run the setup.exe file from the 'Installation files' folder.\r\n\r\n## Images\r\n![Before after OPTI-G](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/runeSal/OPTI-G/master/Images/pcb%20before%20after%20OPTI-G.png)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
